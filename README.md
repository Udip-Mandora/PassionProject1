# PassionProject1

Welcome everyone to my Passion Project. I've spent my 7 weeks on creating and developing this project. It started as a dream and ended as goal.

My passion project is based on mental health issues. As the world is advancing a lot so people are getting lot of issues related to their mental health. This project will
help them to focus on their mental health. They can focus on it while following their routine. This project will suggest them an exercise based on the health issue they
are facing.

Not only this, user will also be able to add an issue by thier selves, edit it as well, read it and delete it as well. Same as issues, user will also able to perform 
all those task on exercises as well.

This project does follow CRUD operations in a smoothly manner making it very useful at the same time. The results of CRUD operations stand on user's expectations.

Anyone will find needed information on this by following git repo. 

To see isses go to issuesController. 

To see exercise go to exerciseController.
